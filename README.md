Greg Dependency Injection provides you a lightweight, but powerful IoC Container
that allows you to standardize and centralize the way objects are constructed in your application.

# Requirements

* PHP Version `^7.1`

# Installation

`composer require greg-md/php-dependency-injection`

# How It Works

All you need to start using the [Dependency Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) technique,
is to instantiate an IoC and define objects in it.

```php
$ioc = new \Greg\DependencyInjection\IoCContainer();

$ioc->inject('foo', Foo::class);

$foo = $ioc->get('foo');
```

### Defining the way your concretes will be instantiated

```php
$ioc->inject('redis.client', function() {
    $redis = new \Redis();

    $redis->connect();

    return $redis;
});
```

### Defining concrete objects

```php
$ioc->inject('foo', new Foo());
```

### Best Practice

In a real application to take advantage of what's best from Dependency Injection technique,
you may want to instantiate objects with dependencies from the IoC Container without defining them manually.
The best way to do that is to inject objects with it's names or it's strategies names as abstracts.

Let say we have the `Foo` class that requires `Bar` strategy.

```php
class Foo
{
    private $bar;
    
    public function __construct(BarStrategy $bar)
    {
        $this->bar = $bar;
    }
}
```

What we do is inject the `BarStrategy` into the IoC Container and load the `Foo` class from it.

> `BarStrategy` in this example is an `interface`,
> so, we don't break the [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)) principles.

```php
$ioc->inject(BarStrategy::class, function() {
    return new Bar();
});

$foo = $ioc->load(Foo::class);
```

Sometimes you may want to redefine one or more dependencies of a class when loading it from the IoC Container.

```php
class Foo
{
    private $bar;
    
    private $baz;
    
    public function __construct(BarStrategy $bar, BazStrategy $bar)
    {
        $this->bar = $bar;
        
        $this->baz = $baz;
    }
}
```

```php
$ioc->inject(BarStrategy::class, function() {
    return new Bar();
});

$ioc->inject(BazStrategy::class, function() {
    return new Baz();
});
```

You can easily do it by defining those dependencies next after the class name in `load` method.

```php
class CustomBaz implements BazStrategy
{
}

$foo = $ioc->load(Foo::class, new CustomBaz());
```

The previous example will instantiate `BarStrategy` from the IoC Container, which is `Bar` class
and for `BazStrategy` it will set the `CustomBaz` defined in the `load` method.
